## Trees of Life and Abundance 


It’s hard to imagine a tropical paradise without the inclusion of coconuts. With their robust shells, tasty flesh, and nourishing liquids – coconuts possess many alluring qualities and types of uses.  Known by 19 different local names, the versatile coconut has traversed through many regions across the globe because of its natural buoyancy and the aid of ocean waves.[^ref1]  These churning waves carried ancestral coconut palm seeds throughout tropical Asia and Oceania respectively.  Additionally, travelers who encountered them also brought them along to share with others on their long journeys. As a result, many different cultures have unique relationships with coconuts; both local populations and colonizing empires were fascinated with the plant. Whether as food, medicine, and or as part of spiritual rituals, the coconut has truly had a wide impact on a number of civilizations.

## Botanical Details


Colloquially, the term “coconut” is used to refer to either the seed or fruit of the coconut palm or _Cocos nucifera_;   older archival documents have also referred to coconuts with the spelling “cocoanut”.[^ref2]  _Cocos_ refers to the monotypic genus of the family _Arecaceae_, while _nucifera_ translates to “nut bearing”. [^ref3] Hilariously, the “nut” of coconut is a misnomer because the  fruit is botanically a drupe.[^ref3]  This scientific name also takes inspiration from early Spanish explorers’ descriptions, who compared the indentations and shagginess of the coconut to resemble a monkey’s head and face.

Coconut palms grow best in locations with free-draining aerated soil, access to fresh groundwater, consistent humidity, and temperatures ranging between 27°C and 30°C.  It is considered a native species in the countries of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Its exotic distribution range is large and multicontinental, typically spanning cross tropical regions located from 25° North and 25° South of the equator.[^ref4] As previously mentioned, coconuts have high capacity of natural dispersion because they can float and are very resilient-- they can stay afloat for up to 120 days in seawater and readily germinate once they make landfall.[^ref5] Unsurprisingly, many countries all over the world are involved in the growth and production of coconuts. Overall, the top three producers are The Philippines, Indonesia, and India.

## Historical Overview


The origins of the coconut began with the breaking up of the pre-historic landmass Gondwana approximately 80 million years ago.  The ancestors of the coconut palm flourished on Gondwana’s northern coasts, where they thrived on the sandy spaces right above high-tide lines.  Unsurprisingly, these coconut palms provided ample nutrients to the inhabitants of these areas – from scurrying coconut crabs (_Birgus latro_) and giant white-tailed rats (_Uromys caudimaculata_) to early humans.

## Traditional and Folk Medicine 

## Food and Cuisine


Cambodian cuisine is both complex and simple. It relies heavily on local ingredients, with fresh and wild fruits, herbs, and vegetables being at the core. Although “Cambodian” and “Khmer” are often used interchangeably, it is important to know that “Cambodian” refers to the collective of all ethic groups of Cambodia while “Khmer” specifically highlights the Khmer ethic group. Given that the Khmer people make up an estimated 94 percent of the population, many foods and dishes considered “traditional” are often Khmer dishes (Minority Rights International).


In Cambodia, the entirety of the coconut tree is used for many things – building materials, charcoal, and of course food (Nak 2019, 28). Both young and ripe coconuts are consumed, either raw or cooked into dishes of all types (Ibid). Dollops of rich coconut cream mixed into curries, stir-fries, and sweets. Crunchy and crispy fried dishes perfectly blossomed in coconut oil. Refreshing coconut water in various drink infusions – the possibilities do seem endless. The following three dishes all feature coconut as a crucial ingredient in their making; they are also quite popular options on restaurant and celebratory menus. 

**Amok អាម៉ុក** 

Amok is a steamed curry with a coconut cream base cooked while enveloped in banana leaves. It is considered one of, if not the, national dish of Cambodia. While there are some variations that use chicken, pork, beef, or tofu as the protein base, the original dish calls for freshwater fish like snakehead or goby. It was said to be a dish created during the times of the glorious Khmer Empire – a delicacy fit only for royalty (Gillan, 2017). Some variations feature different nutritious greens, all of which are dependent on the season (Nak, 2019). It is eaten for both lunch and dinner with some steamed white rice. However, it is not an everyday dish. While some restaurants in Cambodia do serve Amok, it typically takes a long time to make if made the traditional way. As a result, arguably “authentic” Amok is a celebratory dish you might find at weddings or other important ceremonies. 


**Cha Kroeung ឆាគ្រឿង**

Kroeung is a fundamental spice paste base for many dishes in Cambodian cuisine. At the heart of it all is lemongrass, but the makrut lime leaves, galangal, garlic, shallots, and turmeric all have their role. This stir-fry dish combines Kroeung together with coconut cream and a protein of choice. Occasionally, additional vegetables and chilis will be added. It is served for lunch and dinner with some steamed white rice.


**Ja Huoy Doung ចាហួយដូង**

It’s hard to imagine a Cambodian dessert without coconut, palm sugar, rice, tapioca, or fruit involved. This coconut cream jelly is quick and easy to prepare. It is sweet, bouncy, and balanced with the light crunch of shredded coconut within every bite. It’s no surprise it is a well-known and very popular treat at social gatherings.
