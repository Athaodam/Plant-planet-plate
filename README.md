## Trees of Life and Abundance 


It’s hard to imagine a tropical paradise without the inclusion of coconuts. With their robust shells, tasty flesh, and nourishing liquids – coconuts possess many alluring qualities and types of uses.  Known by 19 different local names, the versatile coconut has traversed through many regions across the globe because of its natural buoyancy and the aid of ocean waves.[^ref1]  These churning waves carried ancestral coconut palm seeds throughout tropical Asia and Oceania respectively.  Additionally, travelers who encountered them also brought them along to share with others on their long journeys. As a result, many different cultures have unique relationships with coconuts; both local populations and colonizing empires were fascinated with the plant. Whether as food, medicine, and or as part of spiritual rituals, the coconut has truly had a wide impact on a number of civilizations.

## Botanical Details


Colloquially, the term “coconut” is used to refer to either the seed or fruit of the coconut palm or _Cocos nucifera_;   older archival documents have also referred to coconuts with the spelling “cocoanut”.[^ref2]  _Cocos_ refers to the monotypic genus of the family _Arecaceae_, while _nucifera_ translates to “nut bearing”. [^ref3] Hilariously, the “nut” of coconut is a misnomer because the  fruit is botanically a drupe.[^ref3]  This scientific name also takes inspiration from early Spanish explorers’ descriptions, who compared the indentations and shagginess of the coconut to resemble a monkey’s head and face.

Coconut palms grow best in locations with free-draining aerated soil, access to fresh groundwater, consistent humidity, and temperatures ranging between 27°C and 30°C.  It is considered a native species in the countries of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Its exotic distribution range is large and multicontinental, typically spanning cross tropical regions located from 25° North and 25° South of the equator.[^ref4] As previously mentioned, coconuts have high capacity of natural dispersion because they can float and are very resilient-- they can stay afloat for up to 120 days in seawater and readily germinate once they make landfall.[^ref5]

## Global Coconut Production 

Unsurprisingly, many countries all over the world are involved in the growth and production of coconuts. Overall, the top three producers are The Philippines, Indonesia, and India.

## Historical Overview


The origins of the coconut began with the breaking up of the pre-historic landmass Gondwana approximately 80 million years ago.  The ancestors of the coconut palm flourished on Gondwana’s northern coasts, where they thrived on the sandy spaces right above high-tide lines.  Unsurprisingly, these coconut palms provided ample nutrients to the inhabitants of these areas – from scurrying coconut crabs (_Birgus latro_) and giant white-tailed rats (_Uromys caudimaculata_) to early humans.
